<h1>HTTP</h1>
<p>
  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol for transmitting hypermedia
  documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers,
  but it can also be used for other purposes.
</p>
<p>
  HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a
  client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is
  a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.
